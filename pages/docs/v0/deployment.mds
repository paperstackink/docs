# Deployments

Paperstack websites are just a collection of `.html` files and any assets youâ€™ve provided. Thus, the website can be hosted anywhere that supports static file hosting. Ideally, the server has Node installed, so you can build the site on the server.

## Building the site

Whether you build the site on the server or locally, Node@20.1 is required.

To build the site, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This creates an `Output` directory containing all the `.html` files and assets.
