# What is Paperstack?

Paperstack is a static site generator. It can help you build static HTML websites. It takes `.stencil` files and `.mds` files and compiles them into `.html` files.

Stencil is a new templating language that is similar to HTML but can do more. 

The main feature of Stencil is components. Components are custom HTML elements you can define and reuse throughout your project.

If you were using plain HTML, you would have to copy a similar markup across pages. Menus, layouts, sections, forms and meta tags are often reused on several pages. With Stencil, you can extract those elements into components.
