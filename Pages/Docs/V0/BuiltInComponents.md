# Built-in components

There are a few built-in components in Stencil. The names of these components are reserved and cannot be used for your own components.

-   `<‎Component>`: Is used to [dynamically render components](/docs/v0/dynamic-components)
-   `<‎Data>`: Is used to specify [custom data](/docs/v0/data#custom-data) in Stencil pages
