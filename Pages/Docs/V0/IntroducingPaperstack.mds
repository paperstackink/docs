# What is Paperstack?

Paperstack is a static site generator. It can help you build static HTML websites. It takes a bunch of `.stencil` files youâ€™ve written and compiles them into `.html` files.

Paperstack uses a templating language called Stencil. Stencil is similar to HTML but it can do more. 

The main feature of Stencil is components. Components are custom HTML elements you can define and reuse throughout your project.

If you were using plain HTML you would have to copy a bunch of markup across pages. Navigations, layouts, sections, forms and meta tags are often reused on several pages. With Stencil you can extract those elements into components.
